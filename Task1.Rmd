abstract: "The aim of this short report is to explain to a general audience how to  develop a particular a model  which is able to classify if a hand written number is a $4$ or a $9$. Since the report is written for a general audiente, the writing style is quite relaxed with not many technicisims so that a person with low data-sciencist knoledge can follow it. Further insight can be found in the bibliographic references among the text or in the .rmd file. "

\noidnent For the graph in the Figure 1, complete the following:

![Graph for the assigment.](Graph.png){align="'center'" width="345" label="plot1"}


Before starting to answering the question let's make a quick analysis of the network given. It counts with **$7$ nodes** (*order of the graph*) and **$10$ edges** (*size of the graph*), and notices that it is not a directed graph. There are no loops since there isn't any vertix with a edge going to itself. Let's also remark that there are a lot of possible representations for this graph, this is fact one among all the possibilities. By introducing the graph in R we can see more representations.
# Question 1

**Determine a walk from vertex 2 to vertex 7 that is not a trail.**


```{r}
library(igraph)

set.seed(100484935)
# create empty graph with 7 nodes
g <- graph.empty(n = 7, directed = FALSE)

# add edges to the graph
g <- g + edge(1, 2)+ edge(1, 3)+ edge(2, 3)+ edge(2, 4)+ edge(3, 5) + edge(4, 5) + edge(4, 6) + edge(6, 7) + edge(7, 4)+edge(5,6)

# plot the graph

plot.igraph(g)


```
```{r}
plot.igraph(g)


```

```{r}
plot.igraph(g)

```


# Question 2

**Determine a trail from vertex 2 to vertex 7 that is not a path.** 

# Question 3 
**Determine a path from vertex 2 to vertex 7.** 


# Question 4 

**How many paths are there from vertex 1 to vertex 7? What is the geodesic distance between these two vertices? Is there a unique shortest path between them?** 

#Question 5 

**Obtain the adjacency matrix**

# Ridge logistic model

```{r data, include=FALSE}
#Read the data
load("qmnist_nist.RData")

#Function for plotting numbers images
show_digit <- function(x, col = gray(255:1 / 255), ...) {
l <- sqrt(length(x))
image(matrix(as.numeric(x), nrow = l)[, l:1], col = col, ...)
}

```
